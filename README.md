A Cura resource configuration bundle for BIBO2 printers folowing the [Resources](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/tree/master/resources) and [Quality profiles in Cura](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/tree/master/resources/quality)

The original creation of this resource bundle was heavily influenced by the included [Quality profiles in Cura](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/tree/master/resources/quality) Community profiles from the Facebook BIBO support group, The BIBO provied slicer profiles, The [BIBO2 PrusaSlicer config bundle](https://github.com/photodude/BIBO2-PrusaSlicer) built by Photodude, and the Cura PLA print profile also built by Photodude.
